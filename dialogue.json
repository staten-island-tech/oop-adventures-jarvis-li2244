    "Tutorial: Act I": ["NARRATOR: A man lies on the grassy floor of Anthill Forest. His eyes return a blank stare to the clear sky.",
"???: Hey", 
"???: Hey you, on the ground.", 
"YOU: Me? Who are you? Where are you?",
"OTHER YOU: Let’s just say I’m the “Other You”. I’m a part of you essentially, so no one else can hear me. I’ll be acting like your guide throughout this adventure.",
"YOU: Okay.. wait. Who am I?",
"OTHER YOU: Let’s just call you {player name} for now. Come on, get up. We have a journey to start on.",
"TUTORIAL: Within movement, there are three types of movement. Map, sublocation, and location movement.",
"TUTORIAL: This is the map. To move throughout the grid, use the WASD keys to input which direction you want to move. All youwould need to do is type the key.",
"TUTORIAL: Now that you know how to move, it is important to know that this is the map of one sublocation. The size of the map of each sublocation may vary. Some may be 5x5 or 2x3. Either way, the WASD keys will allow you to move throughout these maps.",
"TUTORIAL: To move to different sublocations, you’ll need to use the “switch sl(“name”)” command where you input the name of the sublocation as the “name” within the parentheses. The “sl” before the parentheses stands for “sublocation”.",
"TUTORIAL: Before we do this, you’ll need to know the names of these sublocations. To find this, you can use the command “info sl” and it will return the sublocations within your location.",
"TUTORIAL: If we use it, we can see there are 8 types of different sublocations to choose one. Let’s go to the Myrminki Village for now.",
"TUTORIAL: You are now at Myrminki Village. Any time you switch sublocations or locations, it will tell you where you are. Last thing to know, each location has 8 types of sublocations and each sublocation can be categorized. Each location has:",
"1 Center SL: Starting Point, can be used in story or quests. ",
"3 Quest SLs: NPCs will be here to give quests out. They will only give these quests after the story portion within the location is completed.",
"3 Event SLs: These are places where you can interact with things. These include shops, healing areas, and another event like storage or puzzles.",
"Wild SLs: This area fills in the rest of the map. This is where you find enemies or loot.",
"TUTORIAL: To switch locations, you can use the “switch l(“name”)” command, but different locations require a certain progress in the story. At the moment, Anthill Forest is the only location available.", 
"TUTORIAL: That’s it for now! If you need any of this information at any time, use the “help” command and choose the movement category to revisit different commands.",
"???: ...",
"???: AHH!",
"???: Please don’t hurt me! I’m just a humble scientist, the head of the science department to be exact, and having 43 metals.. and the owner of Anticore Lab.. an-",
"OTHER YOU: Yeah, he’s humble, that’s for sure.",
"NARRATOR: You sheath your sword and lower your guard. You raise your arms as a sign of peace.",
"???: Oh, you're not here to kill me. Sorry, I thought you were one of these castle guards. I’m Antinine, nice to meet you..",
"NARRATOR: You point to the nametag on your chest.",
"ANTININE: ..{player name}. A silent one, eh? Well, according to law, I’m supposed to take you to the Myrminki Assembly, so… could you possibly.. like, come with me?",
"NARRATOR: You nod.",
"ANTININE: Oh. I didn’t think you would actually agree to that. Well, come with me then. I’ll try to give you my best assistance in this matter. It’s been a while since there has been an outsider.. and I’m running low on inspiration for my next experiments. Hmm.. maybe I could use your blood for something..",
"NARRATOR: You give him an unamused look but follow him nonetheless."

"MYRMINKIAN TRIUMVIRATE: That’s enough Antinine. We understand. You may take your leave now.",
"NARRATOR: Antinine leaves.",
"MYRMINKIAN TRIUMVIRATE: Doesn’t he just ramble on and on?",
"NARRATOR: You shrug.",
"MYRMINKIAN TRIUMVIRATE: Well, since he seems to trust you and you haven’t caused any trouble for us, we’ll allow you to roam around for now. But be warned, if you cause any sort of commotion, you will be punished accordingly. Do you understand?",
"NARRATOR: You nod.",
"MYRMINKIAN TRIUMVIRATE: Forgive us if we are too weary. Legend has told of a man setting flames to all which he walks. You may take your leave now.",
"NARRATOR: You leave."
