"TUTORIAL: Now that you know how to move, it is important to know that this is the map of one sublocation. The size of the map of each sublocation may vary. Some may be 5x5 or 2x3. Either way, the WASD keys will allow you to move throughout these maps.",
"TUTORIAL: To move to different sublocations, you'll need to use the 'switch sl.name' command where you input the name of the sublocation as the 'name'. The 'sl' before the period stands for 'sublocation'.",
"TUTORIAL: Before we do this, you'll need to know the names of these sublocations. To find this, you can use the command 'info sl' and it will return the sublocations within your location.",
"TUTORIAL: If we use it, we can see there are 8 types of different sublocations to choose one. Let's go to the Myrminki Village for now.",
"TUTORIAL: You are now at Myrminki Village. Any time you switch sublocations or locations, it will tell you where you are. Last thing to know, each location has 8 types of sublocations and each sublocation can be categorized. Each location has:",

"Wild SLs: This area fills in the rest of the map. This is where you find enemies or loot.",

    "Act III Item 2": ["GAME: You pick up old newspaper clippings. You stare intently at their words. They seem to detail the history of this town. The founding of this village began when a group of these ant-like creatures combined forces. They built the place from the ground up. An outer wall was created to keep out enemies and protect those within. The next section describes the people of this town. It is speculated that the king from the castle nearby has been performing cruel experiments on human test subjects. His goal was to create a perfect being. He began to experiment with all kinds of species, mixing them with human intelligence. The people in this town and the enemies outside are all results of these experiments, later exiled when no longer needed. The text becomes too faded after that."

Let us think now in peace. That creature could not have hidden its existence for that long. And its origin..",

He was a young boy named Adam living a normal life in a normal village. However, soon, invaders attacked and their village was placed under the rule of King Serpent, the very same one from today. As he watched the people get taken away to never return, his fury only grew stronger. He decided that he could no longer sit back and watch. He had to act.",
"MYRMINKIAN TRIUMVIRATE: And so he did. He gathered an army of those who remained and distributed weapons he had been working on in secret. Then, in the cloak of midnight, they struck the castle hard. For seven days and seven nights they waged war, and the last day was the only time King Serpent ordered a retreat. He managed to escape, but all his men were killed. However, he smiled when he saw the hero and vanished soon after. ",
"MYRMINKIAN TRIUMVIRATE: The next day, the hero was not the same. He was less concerned with the public or the village. He grew quiet, distant, and was never seen for long periods of time. When he was seen, he was never as warm or charming as he once was. He seemed to become more and more bitter and selfish until one day, he too vanished completely. They say that 'Flames' is a creation of his. An experiment per se. An experiment no better than the King's. That is the story of the hero and the 'Flames'."

Except, he was less friendly and open. He kept to himself mostly and rented an underground place to stay. No one knows what he did down there, but some say they could hear bottles clinking even in the middle of the night.",
"CHIBLEE: Everyone let him be, not knowing the danger that was quickly approaching. It was on that fateful day, like any other day, where the village would meet its end. There we were, playing and running around like always, until the man, now in robes and a mask, approached. With fire and steel, he burned the village to the ground. He slaughtered anyone who got in his way, and in the end, I was the sole survivor.",

I can look over a place once mine, and Ratashkin has excellent newspapers. He really helps me learn more about what happened. Turns out, that was his second village, so news had not spread yet. The first could've been a mere accident, but the second signaled an intention. The man was none other than the legend of the 'Flames'."
